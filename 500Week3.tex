\begin{document}


Went more into detail into cognitive and socioculture perspectives, and analyzed data from Dr. Allison Hall's work. Had a discussion on what we observed through the socio-cutulral lens and what we observed through the cognitive lens \parencite{j._pellegrino_perspectives_2012}.
\textit{(Feedback: My paper needs more operational definition with proper cititations, so that the critera used to determine what is cognitive and what is sociocultural will be more clear. Like Gubeladze said, papers need to be self-contained as much as possible!)}
