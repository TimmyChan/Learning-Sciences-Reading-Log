	I attended a paper presentation session called "Embodied Technology in Science Learning", and a talk that really stood out for me was by \href{https://www.education.uw.edu/technologycenter/about-us/meet-the-staff/}{Erin Riesland from University of Washington}, and her email is \href{mailto:erinsage@uw.edu}{erinsage@uw.edu}. She mixed social sciences and VR!! How innovative and what a great perspective.
